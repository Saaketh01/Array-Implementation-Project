## Array Implementation Project
Description:
This project implements a Merge Sort algorithm in Python, where the user can provide an array, and the system will perform merge sort on the array. The project visualizes the merge sort process by printing every iteration of the sorting, showing how the array is progressively divided and merged in each step.

Key Features:
Merge Sort Algorithm: The project implements the merge sort algorithm to sort the array. Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into smaller subarrays, sorts them, and then merges them back together.
Step-by-Step Visualization: As the algorithm progresses, the project prints each iteration, showing how the array is split and merged at each step. This provides a clear understanding of the sorting process.
User Input: Users can input an array of numbers, and the system will execute the merge sort algorithm on it.

Technologies Used:
Python: The programming language used to implement the merge sort algorithm and handle array manipulation.
Merge Sort Algorithm: Used to efficiently sort the array by recursively dividing and merging it.
